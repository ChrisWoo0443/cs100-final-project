## Project Description 
 **The importance of a task scheduler**
 * As college students, we have complex schedules that revolve around our class schedule, extra-curriculars, and personal responsibilities. With all of this going on, it is important to keep track of all tasks     that we have pending, such as homework, 
 to ensure that nothing slips out of our mind. Therefore, it would be great to create a task schedular that can help us manage out schedules efficiently.

 **Technology specifications**
 * We plan on using C++ for this project. We will work on VSCode and use Git features to assist collaboration. We expect the program to be compatible on Windows and macOS, and hopefully will get it working on Linux if possible.

 **Inputs and outputs**
 * **Inputs**: Via terminal commands, the user has various options:
 * Add User: Strings inputted via the command terminal with the names of users or "task collections", such as for dividing work tasks and personal tasks
 * Select User: Choose a user or "task collection" to view
 * Add Task: Strings inputted via the command terminal with the names of tasks
 * Add Task Label: Strings inputted via the command terminal with labels one can use to categorize tasks
 * Priority: Integers inputted via the command terminal to determine how urgent or necessary a task si to complete
 * Remove Task commands, with either a number corresponding to the task list or string to select which task to remove
 * Dates, times, and days of the week to schedule when tasks will be due and/or recurring tasks. 
 * **Outputs**: All outputs will be run from the command terminal in the form of text
 * List of users for the user to select
 * List of tasks in the task collection
 * List of labels associated with tasks
 * Specific details about tasks, such as due date, addition date, or editing task details
 * Statistics, such as task completion rate on-time

 **List of features**
 * Task list view: Quickly see your list of tasks with due dates easily accessible.
 * Task priority: Prioritize which tasks are important to do.
 * Multiple collections: Choose between various "users" or collections with different sets of tasks.
 * Task scheduling: Make tasks recur for various days of the week or timeframes
 * Task statistics: See your task completion rate before due dates 

 > ## Phase II

## User Interface Specification

### Navigation Diagram
This navigation diagrams show the various large screens that users can branch from via the command terminal.
Highlighted in the screen's color is the list of commands the user can do from various screens, besides navigation commands which are implied through arrows.

### Screen Layouts

Description: Our screen layouts are in text because our program will run as plaintext from the terminal. Listed in BOLD are the various "screens" that refer to different major parts of the user interface (including some inputs) and the purpose of these screens is briefly described under the section.

TASK SCHEDULER

Select your TaskList:

1. ExampleTaskList

2. ExampleTaskList2

3. ExampleTaskList3.

Type /tasklist select {#} to select a task list.

Type /tasklist newlist {name} to make a new list.

Type /tasklist delete {#} to delete a task list.

â€”-------------------------------------------------------

Type /help tasklist to view more commands.

Purpose: Entry screen that lets people choose a task.


LIST OF TASKS

Type /task tasklist for viewing all the task lists

Type /tasklist select {#} to see tasks in a task list.

ExampleTaskList:

1. HighestPriorityTask | Due: Unknown

2. 2ndHighestPriorityTask | Due 12/4/2024

3. 3rdHighestPriorityTask | Due 13/4/2025

Type /task view {#} to see the specific details of a task.

Type /task delete{#} to delete the selected task.

Type /task {#}addlabel to add label to the selected task.

Type /task {#} finish to mark task as done.

Type /task {#}removelabel to delete labels for the selected task.

The task ExampleTask has been deleted.


-----------------------------------------

Type /help task to view more commands

Purpose: List of tasks people can view.

TASK STATISTICS:

You have added {int} tasks.

You have completed {int} tasks.

Your success rate is {double} percent.

-----------------------------------------

Type /help task to view more commands

Purpose: Lets people view their statistics.


TASK IN DETAIL:

Task Name: {string}

Description: {string}

Priority: {short}

Labels: {string}, {string}

This task [does not recur / recurs on X days of the week}

Purpose: Lets people view specific details about individual tasks.


7-DAY CALENDAR

Monday:

Tuesday: 

{name} is due

Wednesday:

Thursday:

Friday:

Saturday:

Sunday:

Purpose: Lets people view a calendar about the future and see recurring tasks.


HELP {Category}

/task addtask - Adds a new task.

/task addlist - Adds a new tasklist.

/task rename - Renames a task.

/task changedue - Change due date of a task. 

etc...

Purpose: Lets people see what commands are available. Differs by category.



## Class Diagram

This UML diagram shows the details of the main classes of the project, as well as the relationships between classes.

### Classes:

  The Task class is an object made every time a new task is created. It contains all the basic information of the tasks, as well as functions to edit that information.
  
  The TaskList class is an aggregation of Task objects. It contains a vector that stores all the Task objects, with functions that add/remove tasks, and functions that get information about the tasks. 
  
  InputOutput is a class that will handle all of the I/O operations. This will be a dependency for the rest of the classes.
  
  Statistics is a class that will give back task statistics, and is dependent on the TaskList class.
  
  The date class is an object that will hold the relavent dates. It is a dependency of the Task class.
  
  Task Scheduler is our main class, with TaskList as a dependency.

## Phase III

- We updated out UML digram to reflect recommendations from out TA. We made sure to inclde a more detailed diagram that specifies the relationship that different classes have with each other. This helps us understand the structure of our code better.
- We updated the UML diagram to make sure that our project follows the single-responsibility principle from SOLID. To make this change, we needed to add a Priority class so that the Task class was not responsible for two things. This helps us differentiate our code and focus on one aspect as a time while writing our code.

 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
